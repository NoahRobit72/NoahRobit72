### Hey, I'm Noah! ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ˜ƒ
I am an undergraduate at Boston University studying Computer Engineering. 

In my free time, I enjoy building things. In the past, I have made software applications, woodworking projects, electronic hardware projects, and embedded systems projects.

Currently, I am working on creating a computerized start box called [StartBox](https://github.com/NoahRobit72/StartBox) and a software company called ResearchRatings.com (Repo found [here](https://github.com/NoahRobit72/ResearchRatings)).

I am passionate about building solutions to the problems around me and working to improve the world. Feel free to reach out if you live in Boston or are stopping by. I would love to grab lunch!

My email is noahro at bu.edu
